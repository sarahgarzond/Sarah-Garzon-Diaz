# Hi there
My name is Sarah and I am from Colombia. I am a statistics student at the University of Toronto and I enjoy creating projects that apply data analysis to real life scenarios. Join me in my journey to discover the endless possibilities that the field of data science has to offer and to make the world a better place.
